## cpnt262-ach8, Async Fetch Nuxt

- For this activity I had some help from Jess during a breakout session
- I also followed along during class

- First we want to create an async function
    - Within the function we want to call our Public API
        - Use $fetch
    - We also want to use a try catch function to catch any errors
    - Try Function:
        - We want to create a const called data
        - Then we want to call our const called characters so we can get access to the api
            - We are stuck outside at the beginning because we have to get into the data of the api
- We then want to recall our function afterwards so it runs
- In our template, all we need to do is call our function in moustache syntax
